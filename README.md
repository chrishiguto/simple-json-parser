# Simple JSON parser written in Rust

This Rust JSON parser is my way of diving into [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and getting comfortable with the language.
Although not intended to fully implement JSON specifications, the project provides a pratical experience with Rust while building an interpreter.
Emphasizing a few key language concepts and patterns, this implementation is supposed to be concise and simple.
